/**
 * Productization modes — pre-baked starter configurations for common call
 * orchestration use-cases. Each mode declares default channels, automation
 * rule seeds, dashboard labels, AI receptionist profiles, and transfer
 * targets. Applied IDEMPOTENTLY by the setup wizard: a slot is only
 * seeded if the user has zero of that resource type.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is administrative routing only. The Medical mode
 * intentionally avoids any clinical/diagnostic claims — its actions are
 * scheduling and intake routing, never medical advice. Field service has
 * NO automotive diagnostic claims either.
