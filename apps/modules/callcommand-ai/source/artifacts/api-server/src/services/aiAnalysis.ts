Caller: Hi Marcus, this is Jordan Lee from Northside Dental. Our practice management server has been crashing for the past two days and we're losing appointment data.
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that, Jordan. Can you tell me roughly when it started?
Caller: Tuesday afternoon, around two o'clock. We've already lost three appointments and our office manager is panicking.
Agent: Understood. Let me pull up your account. I see you're on the Business plan. I can have a senior tech remote in within the hour and we'll do a full database integrity check.
Caller: That would be huge. Also, can someone follow up about upgrading our backup retention? We never want to be in this spot again.
Agent: Absolutely. I'll create a ticket for both items right now and our account manager Priya will reach out tomorrow with a quote.
Caller: Perfect, thanks Marcus. My direct line is 415-555-0142.
Agent: Got it. You'll get a confirmation email in about five minutes.`;

Hard rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the requested schema. No prose, no markdown, no comments.
- Ground EVERY field in evidence from the transcript. If something is not stated, return null (or an empty array). Do NOT guess names, companies, phone numbers, dates, or amounts.
- Transcripts come from automatic speech recognition and may contain misheard words, missing punctuation, and speaker-label confusion. Prefer null over a guess.
- Never include clinical diagnoses, medical advice, legal advice, or financial advice — even if the caller asked for them. Summarize the request administratively.
- Never include personally identifying information (full SSNs, full credit-card numbers, government IDs) in any field. If the caller shared one, redact to last 4 digits.
- Be specific, decisive, and concise. No emojis. No hedging language ("it seems", "perhaps") in summary or keyPoints — state what was said.
- internalNotes is for the rep's eyes only: tactical observations, NOT judgments about the caller's character.`;
  const user = `Analyze the call transcript between <TRANSCRIPT> markers below and return a single JSON object with this exact shape:

{
  "summary": string,                       // 1-4 sentences. Sparse transcripts get a shorter summary. What happened, what was decided, what's next.
  "customerName": string | null,           // exact name said on the call, else null
  "companyName": string | null,            // exact company name said on the call, else null
  "callerPhone": string | null,            // E.164 if given (e.g. "+14155550142"), else null
  "callType": ("sales" | "support" | "complaint" | "inquiry" | "follow-up" | "other") | null,  // null when the transcript doesn't make it clear
  "intent": string | null,                 // 1 sentence: what the caller wants to accomplish
  "priority": "low" | "medium" | "high" | "urgent",  // urgent = outage, safety, or revenue-blocking
  "sentiment": "positive" | "neutral" | "negative" | "mixed",
  "keyPoints": string[],                   // up to 6 short bullets, each <= 120 chars. Empty array if there's nothing concrete to list.
  "followUpMessage": string | null,        // 1-3 sentences the rep can send the caller verbatim. No emojis. No placeholders like [name]. Null if a follow-up doesn't make sense.
  "internalNotes": string | null,          // <= 280 chars. Tactical context for the rep. Not a re-summary. Null if you have nothing useful to add.
  "suggestedTags": string[],               // up to 6 short kebab-case tags drawn from the transcript content. Empty array if nothing tag-worthy.
  "crmJson": object,                       // small flat object of structured fields you can confidently extract; keep it under ~12 keys. Empty object {} is fine.
  "actionItems": Array<{
    "title": string,                       // imperative, <= 80 chars
    "description": string | null,          // optional one-liner
    "priority": "low" | "medium" | "high",
    "dueDate": string | null               // ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) only if the caller specified a deadline; else null
  }>                                        // up to 5 items. Empty array if no follow-ups are warranted.
}

Reminder: it is correct and expected to return null / empty arrays when the transcript doesn't support a confident value. Do not pad output to hit a count.

Priority guide:
- urgent: caller reports an active outage, safety risk, or hard deadline today
- high: business-impacting issue or hot lead with explicit timeline this week
- medium: normal request with clear next step
- low: FYI, general question, no follow-up demanded
